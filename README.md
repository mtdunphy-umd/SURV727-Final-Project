# SURV727-Final-Project

## Introduction
Since 2010 and the controversial decision of Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission (FEC), the amount of money spent on political campaigns has risen exponentially. In 2010, a midterm election where infamously Republicans picked up a half dozen seats in the Senate and more than 60 seats in the House, political expenditures totaled around 3.6 billion dollars. In 2022, that number is projected to be around $8.9B. (https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/cost-of-election?cycle=2020&display=T&infl=N)

Candidates with more money win more often, so fundraising has become a critical indicator of election forecasting and understanding the current political climate. (https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/winning-vs-spending)

Major partisan events that dominate the greater political discussion often cause a mass influx of money to political campaigns. With each fundraising cycle there are candidates that perform above and below expectations based on candidate quality and the overall political climate. Our goal is to identify those trends in contributions that correlate with significant political shocks during the 2022 midterm cycle, as well as identify characteristics of candidates that affected fundraising performance. In our analysis, we build 3 linear models to identify which characteristics were significant in fundraising among house candidates, senate candidates, and candidates running in competitive districts. We also build 3 logistic models predicting change of win in the general election among the same groups - controlling for the characteristics of their districts. We conduct principal component analysis to identify which variables are the most predictive for our model. We also utilize data visualizations such as comparing top fundraisers by party and office. We also plot fundraising numbers over time through the 2022 election year by day and week.

## Data

Data collected for this analysis came from multiple sources. To start, we collected data from 538’s “2022 Primary Project” GitHub repository (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/primary-project-2022) which tracked the 2022 midterm primary candidates at the federal level. We processed this data to extract general election candidates by filtering candidates based on whether or not they won their primary election (or if there was one, their runoff election). 900 candidates were pulled with information on endorsements, incumbency status, race, and gender of the candidates. 

Contributions to candidates were provided by the FEC (https://www.fec.gov/) which tracks federal level campaign finance information. We tried using the FEC API, relying on the R.openFEC package (https://rdrr.io/github/robinspollak/R.openFEC/man/) in R, but were unsuccessful in processing the data in a reasonable time, and thus shifted methods to pulling data straight from the FEC website. This data included ‘Candidate-committee linkages’ and ‘Contributions by individuals’ on the bulk data webpage (https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data). The 538 general election candidate data set was joined with the candidate-committee linkages FEC data set by office, state, district, and candidate last name to get FEC candidate IDs and committee IDs that will be used later on into the analysis. 

Individual contribution bulk data was brought into R and found to have discrepancies and errors. Due to this, we manually pulled individual state receipts (https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2022&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022&recipient_committee_type=S&recipient_committee_type=H) for the year of 2022 using custom filters and unioned together in R. Receipt data is up to the last FEC report date which was 10/19/2022. This data was joined with our candidate data set on candidate ID and committee ID to view total fundraising numbers for each candidate as well as the timeline of contributions.

Google trends data was provided by Google, using the gtrendsR R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf) to identify key issues that were of high salience in this election cycle. We wanted to focus on the issue of abortion and Trump’s influence which is why we searched the following terms: ‘abortion’, ‘supreme court’, ‘Trump’, ‘FBI’, and ‘crime’. Crime was included as a comparison as it was another major issue for many voters this cycle.

District level data was provided by Dave’s Redistricting App (DRA) (https://davesredistricting.org/maps#home) for each state. This data was manually collected for each state and inputted into this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15UnM1AwmAdRYDmmO-F85M5VrMG7TYAiYW2-ofoGf3ic/edit?usp=sharing). The sources of data and processing done to calculate these values for districts can be viewed on DRA’s website (https://davesredistricting.org/maps#aboutdata). Data that was used included the percentage of white voters in 2020, the 2020 presidential vote share for each party, and the composite score for each party for each district. Composite scores are the mean share of the votes for presidential, senate, governor, and attorney general races from 2016 to 2020 for each party (2016 to 2021 for districts in New Jersey and Virginia). Only Utah’s districts did not have composite score data.

Election result data was manually collected for the New York Times Midterm Tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-senate.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=election-results&context=election_recirc&region=NavBar) for house and senate candidates and inputted into this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1azMpRjQ9sRgW_ULf6qvpouKnwAHWRi_eY1U-RnLPKjI/edit?usp=sharing). During this process, we identified discrepancies between our candidate data and the information shown on NYT (a deceased house incumbent and districts that had no opponent). We used this information to filter districts in our final data set used for analysis.
